Nick Nordale, Kimiko Farmer, Wei-Jen Chiang Final Project


For our final project we are redesigning the site http://www.mollyscaribbean.com/.
Our primary goal is the improve the site on a mobile display.
We will also be making some general design improvements to the desktop layout - specifically, we see room for significant improvement on the pages that display customer reviews and FAQs.

We will be making two versions:
(1) The site described above for our client, and then (2) we will add some additional features just for this project. For example, a search bar, a sign up for their emailing list and saving them to Parse or Firebase, a tropical photobooth so potential customers can "picture themselves in paradise", add the current weather in the Caribbean, and adding a video of the ocean as the background for the top header section.
