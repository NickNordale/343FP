Nick Nordale, Kimiko Farmer, Wei-Jen Chiang Final Project


For our final project we are redesigning the site http://www.mollyscaribbean.com/.
Our primary goal is the improve the site on a mobile display.
We will also be making some general design improvements to the desktop layout - specifically, we see room for significant improvement on the pages that display customer reviews and FAQs.
