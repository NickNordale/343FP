                    <h2>Will travel insurance protect against hurricanes and severe weather in the Caribbean?</h2>
                    <p>The point of travel insurance is that you won’t probably need it, but if and when you do, you’ll be happy you have it–as long as it is appropriate for your vacation.</p>

                    <h2>I’m internet savvy, why not book my own Sandals honeymoon?</h2>
                    <p>According to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, Washington State ranks number three and Oregon ranks number eight, in the highest percentage of Internet users in the United States. So as a web savvy Seattle or Portland native, it would make perfect sense that you would handle your own travel arrangements for your upcoming honeymoon or vacation. Before you do, just consider the following three things.</p>

                    <p>Sandals requires a credit (not debit) card at check-in. Be sure you have a minimum of $400-500 available on your card. If you charge incidentals to your room, your card will be charged when you check-out.</p>

                    <p>Oh, yes, we get sun here in the Pacific Northwest, and Washington and Oregon have some of the most breathtaking beach vistas on the Pacific coast. But packing for your first Caribbean Sandals experience is quite different than packing for a summer weekend on Cannon Beach.</p>

                    <h2>Is the Caribbean a safe destination for my honeymoon?</h2>
                    <p>Jamaica is a perfect example to illustrate this point.
                        Jamaica is a beautiful island with wonderful, gracious people. I send hundreds of honeymooners there every year and I visit Jamaica frequently. It’s a shame how the island can be misrepresented in the media because tourism is their economic mainstay. I have sent hundreds of honeymooners to Jamaica. If it wasn’t a safe island, I wouldn’t be able to stay in business!</p>

                    <h2>Will a hurricane In The Caribbean ruin my travel plans?</h2>
                    <p>One of the most common questions I hear from brides, grooms, and even frequent travelers is about how a hurricane could possibly impact their Caribbean destination wedding, honeymoon or vacation. This is a valid concern especially to those of us from the Seattle and Portland areas, whose only exposure to this weather phenomenon is from what we see on the news.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to hospitality, Jamaica really means it. Jamaicans are as warm as the turquoise Caribbean Sea, and since 1968, the Jamaican Tourist Board has paired island visitors with island residents for a true taste of the Jamaica.</p>

                    <h2>What are the benefits to Caribbean destination wedding?</h2>
                    <p>With the average wedding nudging close to $10,000, I am seeing more and more Seattle and Portland brides and grooms-to-be considering having a destination wedding—for good reasons. Destination weddings are a great way to make any ceremony memorable, and in a tough economy, the best way to maximize your wedding budget. Sounds counter intuitive?</p>
